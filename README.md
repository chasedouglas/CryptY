# CryptY
Simple CryptX Replacement

This was created for a client as a part of a solution to get rid of bulky plugins in their wordpress website. The orginial plugin added a ton of JS files and CSS files when this could all be handled with a simple PHP function and a couple of lines of JS in the footer.

How To Use:
- Place the code from the functions.php file in your functions.php file
- Add the code from the js file to the footer of your website
- OR you can include the js file in the function
